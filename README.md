# staxofstories

The existing website is www.staxofstories.com. This existing site is using class components rather than functional components. 
I have been working on the new site refactoring to functional components this should give you some insight on the kind of code I am using to build this project. 

Tech Stack is React, Apollo, Graphql, Next.js, Keystone and Mongo DB

Clone the repo

open up two terminals one for backend folder and frontend folder.

run npm i on both.

And then run npm run dev.
